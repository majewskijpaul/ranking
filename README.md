## Ranking 

An elo-like ranking system for single and double table tennis matches played. Results are graphed after each recorded match.

Each new player registered in the player pool is given 1500 points. 

Matches consist of a player or a team on "left" side with the opposing side on "right" side. Games can be played to any score provided that the winner wins by at least two points.

### Ranking System

The amount of points gained or lost after a match depends on three factors:

1. The elo ranking of both players
2. The score discrepancy at the end of the match
3. Any special multipliers added as part of tournaments

If a higher ranked player wins against a lower ranked player, the amount of points gained/lost will not be significant, even if the score discrepancy was large. If an "underdog" defeats a stronger opponent, the amount of points gained/lost will be significant, but not enough to completely upset the rankings. Keep winning and we know it won't be a fluke!

## Charts

There are two types of charts that can be plotted:

1. An elo graph which shows the score of each player over time
2. A head-to-head chart which shows the results of a specific matchup between two players

The charts can be displayed by running `main.py`.
